# TiVives
Bharima wearing a red ,gold and green dress, Vajra Lion , Retchung, invoking master Mila at the stomach shape cave ...
At the Feet of Marpa my Guru I prostrate , Wave after wave ..
Finally I requested the Guru, the Mantra to get teleported to
the Monsanto spaceport, wishing to make my way back to Alderan or Tatooine.

The Guru asked me to make pilgrimage this power place:

With a foil and kitesurf or with a downwind foil Circumbalate around its center 108 thousand times while reciting the mantra written below ,until the
local nagas notice me :

**ohm Koming Koming Kokoman itzu tsha tsha tsha **

BE AWARE:

The tivives Nagas will appear like mini cute white dolphins whose can only be seen by people who developed the dark vision before, If you consider guilty of a capital sin , the Nagas always drag an awful mini cute Beluga guardian of the abbyss who produces punishment. (sir francis drake no pudo volver a culiar ni ser pederasta por andar marineros de Megalaya que le ayudaron a trasladar gases a Monsanto ... )

But first Write a dozen Midi Plugins based on the the Prajnaparamita verses
Load them in a Roland Jupiter hidden in a zen temple in the island of Kobe ..
